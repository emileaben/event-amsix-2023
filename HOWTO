### this is a walk-through for how to use BigQuery and local scripts to
### do an analysis around an IXP (or other?) outage around the
### "Does the Internet route around damage?" theme

## Copied from LINX event ( work/event-linx-atlas-trace )
# and adapted to AMS-IX outage on 2023-11-22

#### step1 ( GCP web UI )
# query to select pairs of prb_id/dst_addr (NOT msm_id!) that went through
# AMS-IX on "training day" , ie. the day before

===
with filtered_data as (
 select t.*
 from `ripencc-atlas`.measurements.traceroute t, UNNEST(hops) AS hop
 where start_time >= "2023-11-21" and start_time < "2023-11-22"
 and ( ( af = 4 and NET.IP_TRUNC(hop.hop_addr_bytes, 21) = NET.IP_FROM_STRING("80.249.208.0") ) or ( af =6 and hop.hop_addr LIKE "2001:7f8:1:%") )
),
unq_traces as (
SELECT ANY_VALUE( filtered_data).*
FROM   filtered_data
GROUP BY TO_JSON_STRING(filtered_data)
)

SELECT prb_id, dst_addr, count(*) as count
FROM unq_traces
GROUP BY prb_id, dst_addr
===

# Save this to a temp-table in the bq webUI
# in this case
- project: prod-atlas-project
- dataset: temp_tables ( so it auto-deletes after 7 days)
- table: ams-ix-train-pairs

( 337,601 pairs. The IPv4 query earlier had 146,925 pairs )

### step2 ( GCP web UI )
# query: for all pairs that we see on training day extract full traceroutes
# for those pairs where we see >48 hits (ie. it sees the lan at least every 30 mins)
# DO this for training day AND 'event day' 
#### NOTE: do this in the webUI by clicking through to the pairs table and then go to the 'query' button. If I just queried from another tab I ran into permission issues (!?)
===
select t.*
from `ripencc-atlas`.measurements.traceroute t, `prod-atlas-project.temp_tables.ams-ix-train-pairs` as pairs
where start_time >= "2023-11-21" and start_time < "2023-11-24"
and af = 4 and t.prb_id=pairs.prb_id and t.dst_addr=pairs.dst_addr and pairs.count >= 48
order by t.prb_id, t.msm_id, t.start_time
===

# Save this to a temp-table in the bq webUI
# in this case
- project: prod-atlas-project
- dataset: temp_tables
- table: ams-ix-outage-traces1

# Then navigate to this new temp table (you can't do this directly! causing extra query cost on the platform .... grrr) and in the webUI go to 'export' -> 'export to gcs'

created a json (newline delimited) export, with GZIP

# I created a new bucket: 'eaben-amsix-traces1' with the following settings:
- I selected 'region: eu' 
- access control: I unchecked 'enforce public access prevention on this bucket'
and kept the rest of bucket settings default

# then created a filename: "eaben-amsix-traces1-*.gz"
# gs://eaben-amsix-traces1/eaben-amsix-traces1-*.gz

### step3 ( local compute, in my case: my laptop )

# download the data
mkdir ./data
cd ./data
gsutil cp -r gs://eaben-amsix-traces1 .

# this creates an eaben-amsix-traces1 subdir ...

# note that various gsutil cp command options didn't work for me, for instance:
# gsutil cp "gs://eaben-amsix-traces/eaben-amsix-traces-*.gz" ./data
# DOES NOT WORK

( 1.9G of compressed traceroutes )

### step4 (local scripts)
# 'remix' creates a single file per src/dst pair to easy analysis

mkdir ./pairs
time ./remix.py

# note: this step takes a lot of time. Example: 2:10:09.66 (> 2hrs!)
# TODO: Agustin: I think there is a reshuffle happening in min_rtt that groups the external files into one-file-per-src/asn. If you can share how you did that, that would help this type of IXP analysis

### step5 (local scripts)
## processing of traces into a smaller signal
# TODO: add/change the peering LANs to the top of the 'process-pairs.py' script
time ./process-pairs.py > suitability.pairs.txt
time ./pairs-via-ixps.py > infras.pairs.txt

# process-pairs: 49:05.94
# pairs-via-ixps: 51:58.35


### step6 (local script)
### calculate the pairs that are 'reliable' on test day:
## FIRST: add/change the date of the 'test' period (ie. the first day, in this case 2023-11-22T00:00:00Z)
./suitable-pairs.py > reliability.pairs.test.txt

## step7 (local scripts, plotting)
## binning of error rates:
### TODO: edit the plot-failrate gnuplot script
./bin-failrates.py | tee failrate.counts.txt
gnuplot < plot-failrate.gnuplot

## step8 (local scripts, plotting)
## which other infra was seen?
### after running the first command, you see the list of peering LANs in the header of the infra.counts.txt
## TODO: edit the plot script . Esp the labels for the various parts
./bin-infras.py > infra.counts.txt
gnuplot < plot-other.gnuplot
